# NodeJS MongoDB Assignment
## April 23, 2022
#### Set up assignment folder and github, and connected them.
#### Created app, collection, models, and routes folders with their respective files. Currently researching how to do post. The rest are mostly finished. Just some final editing and testing needed to finish the others. Post needs the most attention currently.
#### Re-read instructions. Post is set up how it's supposed to be. All code is working as it's supposed to be. Just have to test it now.
